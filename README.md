# RecipeManager

# Description of the project
As the title suggests, this is an application that allows the user to organize recipes. The application was designed from scratch (a blank HTML page). It was build using HTML5, SASS (CSS preprocessor), and for the biggest part, Vanilla JavaScript. The JS code is managed according to a Model-View-Controller (#MVC) architecture pattern to account for scalability, maintainability and expandability. To bundle scripts, the application uses Webpack module bundler.

# Features

- Search a recipe using one or more keywords
- Render search results in pages of six recipes each
- Filter search results per catogory
- View a recipe
- Add a recipe to a favourites list
- Add a recipe to a featured list
- Add a new recipe
- Edit a recipe
- Delete a recipe

# API Endpoints
To implement the features above, the application sends HTTP requests to the backend (or uses APIs). In all cases, the sent data and the received data is in the JSON Format. The backend part of the project is done by Dani Stark https://github.com/danistark1/recipesAPI.

# More details about the project and How to use it

- Project's Design and responsiveness: <br>
The project is responsive. It is built with a Desktop-first strategy that accounts for bigger and for smaller screens using media queries. Breakpoints selection is based on average sizes of groups of devices in portrait and landscape modes as well as following the points where the design breaks. 

See the below example for responsiveness of the header section that transforms to a burger menu for devices with a screen size smaller than 600px.

Not all of them are required for this project. See the src folder for more details https://github.com/PascaleStark/RecipeManager/tree/main/src/sass
