# RecipeManager

# Description of the project
As the title suggests, this is an application that allows the user to organize recipes. The application was designed from scratch (a blank HTML page). It was build using HTML5, SASS (CSS preprocessor), and for the biggest part, Vanilla JavaScript. The JS code is managed according to a Model-View-Controller (#MVC) architecture pattern to account for scalability, maintainability and expandability. To bundle scripts, the application uses Webpack module bundler.

# Features
To organize recipes in a flexible and practical way, many features were built in this project where the user can:

- Search a recipe using one or more keywords
- Render search results in pages of six recipes each
- Filter search results per catogory
- View a recipe
- Add a recipe to a favourites list
- Add a recipe to a featured list
- Add a new recipe
- Edit a recipe
- Delete a recipe

# API Endpoints
